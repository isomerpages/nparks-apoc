Singapore, 26 April 2023 – The National Parks Board (NParks), in partnership with the Orchid Society of South East Asia (OSSEA), is organising the Asia Pacific Orchid Conference (APOC) at the Singapore EXPO from 16 to 20 August 2023. The 14th edition of APOC will be held in Singapore for the first time since the inaugural edition in 1984. This year’s APOC, with the theme “Diversity, Conservation, Culture”, comprises a five-day Orchid Show and a four-day Conference Programme. 

Highlights of the Orchid Show include an orchid plant competition with over 100 categories and an orchid landscape competition featuring over 30 displays by orchid societies and associations as well as professional growers from across the Asia-Pacific region, many of whom have clinched awards in previous international orchid shows. The competitions will be judged by esteemed orchid experts from Singapore and the region. Winners will be announced on 16 August 2023. 

The Conference Programme held from 16 to 19 August is targeted at orchid researchers and cultivators, and will feature plenary talks and a scientific poster presentation session. The speakers will cover a range of topics from orchid diversity and conservation to orchid culture and hybridisation. There will also be technical tours to the National Orchid Garden and other features at the Singapore Botanic Gardens, such as the Learning Forest and Gallop Extension. 

Ticket sales for the Orchid Show and Conference Programme starts today, 26 April 2023, and members of the public can enjoy an early bird discount from now till 30 June 2023.

Held every three years, the Asia Pacific Orchid Conference is the largest gathering of orchid researchers, professional growers, and enthusiasts in the Asia-Pacific region.
