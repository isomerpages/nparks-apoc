About Singapore EXPO
--------------------

Situated within the buzzing, multicultural hub of Singapore, Singapore EXPO is the country’s largest purpose-built meetings, incentives, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) venue. With interconnected event spaces spanning 10 halls and 32 meeting rooms, the award-winning venue is versatile and scalable, easily accommodating business or consumer events of any size.  
  
As a trusted venue partner with over twenty years of exhibition and event experience, Singapore EXPO offers elevated experiences through curated and compelling spaces. More than just a venue, we also provide an extensive repertoire of services beyond event and venue management, presenting customers and visitors alike work and leisure options under one roof.

Located in the Changi precinct, we are a 10-minute drive from Changi Airport, and 20-minutes from the city center. We are close to three major expressways and easily accessed via public transport, with the EXPO train station being an interchange for two Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) lines. Our venue is supported by an extensive range of amenities, including WIFI-enabled network, 5G mobile coverage, and over 1,600 car park lots to accommodate visitors’ needs.  
  
Our location also allows visitors a glimpse into the uniquely-Singaporean history and lifestyle through well-loved places of interest like the First Heritage Town Joo Chiat and Jewel Changi Airport.
