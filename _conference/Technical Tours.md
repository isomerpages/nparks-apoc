#### National Orchid Garden Tour

The National Orchid Garden at the Singapore Botanic Gardens is home to the largest and most comprehensive permanent tropical orchid display in Asia. Established in 1995, it houses approximately 3,000 orchid hybrids and 1,500 orchid species. The garden plays a significant role in the development of the orchid industry in the region and the conservation of Singapore's native orchid species.

The garden recently introduced the Tropical Montane Orchidetum, featuring new and enhanced spaces for orchid and flora displays. It comprises two outdoor features – the Lowland Habitat Trail and Secret Ravine – as well as three display houses – the Yuen Peng McNeice Bromeliad Collection, Tan Hoon Siang Mist House, and The Sembcorp Cool House. Each display area exhibits landscapes and plant assemblages unique to the various habitat types that can be found at the different altitudinal zones of tropical mountains. The intent is to bring visitors through a series of contrasting yet complementary landscapes that culminate in the high-elevation montane forest experience of The Sembcorp Cool House.

#### Heritage Tour

For over 160 years, Singapore Botanic Gardens has been the birthplace of Southeast Asia's rubber and orchid industries. A walk through the Tanglin / Heritage Core of the Gardens will evoke memories of bygone days when ladies strolled through the Gardens with parasols and long skirts. Highlights of the tour include the Bandstand, various sculptures, Heritage Trees, the Main Gate, and Saraca Stream Walk.

#### Learning Forest Tour

The Learning Forest is located in Tyersall-Gallop Core of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is designed to integrate with the existing 6-hectare Rain Forest to form an enlarged forest habitat. It features a network of boardwalks and elevated walkways that allow visitors to explore habitats ranging from a freshwater forest wetland to a lowland rainforest. Visitors can learn about freshwater forest wetland ecosystems at the Keppel Discovery Wetlands and walk amongst a collection of some of the tallest tree species in Southeast Asia at the SPH Walk of Giants.
