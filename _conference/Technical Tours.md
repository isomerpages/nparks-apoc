#### National Orchid Garden Tour

The National Orchid Garden, opened on 20 October 1995, is located on the highest hill in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Three hectares of carefully landscaped slopes provide a setting for over 1,000 species and 2,000 hybrids, with about 600 species and hybrids on display. The distinctive feature of the National Orchid Garden not to be missed is its design concept which presents the display of plants in four separate colour zones over most of its areas:
* "spring" zone with its prevailing colours of bright and lively shades of gold, yellow and creams
* "summer" zone with its major tones of strong reds and pinks
* "autumn" zone of matured shades
* "winter" zone of whites and cool violet shades
 
 This colour zoning is achieved by a careful blend of selected trees, shrubs, herbs and orchids (mostly hybrids) with matching foliage and floral colours.

#### Heritage Tour

For over 150 years, Singapore Botanic Gardens has been the birthplace of Southeast Asia's rubber and orchid industries. A walk through the Tanglin / Heritage Core of the Gardens will evoke memories of bygone days when ladies strolled through the Gardens with parasols and long skirts. Highlights of the tour include the Bandstand, various sculptures, Heritage Trees, the Main Gate, and Saraca Stream Walk.

#### Learning Forest Tour

The Learning Forest is located in Tyersall-Gallop Core of the Singapore Botanic Gardens. It is designed to integrate with the existing 6-hectare Rain Forest to form an enlarged forest habitat. It features a network of boardwalks and elevated walkways that allow visitors to explore habitats ranging from a freshwater forest wetland to a lowland rainforest. Visitors can learn about freshwater forest wetland ecosystems at the Keppel Discovery Wetlands and walk amongst a collection of some of the tallest tree species in Southeast Asia at the SPH Walk of Giants.
