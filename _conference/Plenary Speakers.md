| ![Dr Hong Liu](/images/dr%20hong%20liu.jpg)  **Dr Hong Liu** <br> <br> Department of Earth and Environment, AHC5-387 <br> International Center for Tropical Botany (ICTB) Florida International University <br> <br> Research Scientist <br> Center for Tropical Plant Conservation (CTPC) <br> Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden | Dr Hong Liu is a tenured Professor in the Department of Earth and Environment, Florida International University (FIU). She is a conservation ecologist whose research focuses on generating insights that can guide conservation and management efforts for endangered plant species. Her current research addresses important environmental issues such as the impact of global changes on rare orchid populations as well as the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of heavily exploited plant species. She has first authored or co-authored over 80 peer-reviewed articles and book chapters mostly published in top journals such as *Conservation Biology* and *Biological Conservation*. <br> <br>Dr Liu’s research on wild orchid conservation has served to support various biodiversity conservation initiatives internationally. She led the organisation of the first three Guangxi International Orchid Symposium, China, in 2009, 2010, and 2012, which promoted and facilitated dialogues among nature reserve managers, biodiversity researchers and policymakers. In particular, the inaugural symposium successfully drew the attention of several key Chinese national biodiversity conservation officials to a remote yet important orchid-rich area and expedited the establishment of a national nature reserve – the Guangxi Yachang Orchid National Nature Preserve. Together with colleagues, her research on the wild orchid trade in China, both online and offline, generated important quantitative data for the region. She was able to apply her research on the wild orchid trade to the Red List assessment of Chinese orchids, pointing out the significant underestimation of the threats to Chinese orchids from unregulated trade. She has also contributed to the critical revision process of the List of National Key Protected Wild Plants of China, a list similar to the US Federal Endangered Species. She has served as a member of the IUCN SSC Orchid Specialist Group since 2010 and the wild orchid trade subgroup since 2016, under the IUCN umbrella. |
|![Martin Motes](/images/martin%20motes.jpg) | Martin R. Motes, Ph.D., a Research Associate at Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden, has maintained a lifelong interest in the genus *Vanda*. He began collecting new hybrids from Hawaii and Singapore in the late 1950s. While in high school, he imported Vanda species from India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand in to select the best flowered forms for hybridisation and propagation. His career in horticulture was disrupted by the war in Vietnam. Following a Ph.D., and teaching stints in Ohio and Kosovo, he returned to Florida to resume breeding with the remnants of his *Vanda* collection.   <br><br> By the mid-1970’s, Thailand became the center of *Vanda* breeding, thanks to Rapee Sagarik's pioneering work. As only a limited number of species were being used for breeding, Martin recognised the potential of other *Vanda* species, and initiated a breeding program to introduce them to modern bloodlines. His results and experiences were published in the *American Orchid Society Bulletin*, and the book *Vandas*, their *History, Botany and Culture*. Martin’s unique and striking hybrids won all of the medals in the initial international judging at the 18th World Orchid Conference, with his *V.* Mary Motes voted Best in Show and awarded a Gold Medal. <br> <br> Martin, together with Dr David Roberts and Dr Lauren Gardiner of the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, produced a monograph of *Vanda*. This research resulted in Martin identifying *V. alicae*, a previously undescribed species, based on a drawing by J.J. Smith, and led him to Bacan Island where he located a cultivated source which provided the type specimen of *V. alicae*. He also discovered Rumphius’ *V. furva* and *V. saxatilis* on the island of Ceram, and *V. bartholomewii* in the South Moluccas. <br> <br> Martin wrote the cultural notes on *Aeridinae* in *Genera Orchidacearum VI* and continues breeding hybrids and improving *Vanda* species. |
